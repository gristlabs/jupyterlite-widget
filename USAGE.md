In the custom widget configuration, choose "JupyterLite Notebook". If that's not available, choose “Custom URL” and paste the following URL:

https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-widget/jupyterlite/lab/index.html

See the [documentation](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#jupyterlite-notebook) for information on using the widget and what it can do. The source code for that page is [here](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-help/blob/master/help/widget-custom.md).
